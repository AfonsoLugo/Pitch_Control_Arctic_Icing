# Pitch_Control_Arctic_Icing

A new method to analyse icing events on wind turbine's power production and optimize it with pitch control system

Files "Cpmax" analyse the aerodynamic coefficients from "Aerodynamic data.csv" file and print the main values that are used in "Power Losses Icing" file, that prints the graphs of yearly losses, monthly mean losses and power curve of a weather data series from "MERRA2" files.
