# Pitch_Control_Arctic_Icing

This project is the moethod described in the master thesis "PITCH CONTROL SYSTEM FOR A SPECIFIC ARCTIC WIND TURBINE" done in LUT Universisty in Lappeenranta, Finland and Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic University, in Saint Petersburg, Russia.

A new method to analyse icing events on wind turbine's power production and optimize it with pitch control system

Files "Cpmax" analyse the aerodynamic coefficients from "Aerodynamic data.csv" file and print the main values that are used in "Power Losses Icing" file, that prints the graphs of yearly losses, monthly mean losses and power curve of a weather data series from "MERRA2" files.
